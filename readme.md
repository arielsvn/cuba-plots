This is a collection of notebooks with different analysis of data that I have found related to Cuba.

# Notebooks

- [Outgoing flights from top airports](http://arielrodriguezromero.com/cuba-plots/00-outgoing-flights.nb.html)
  ![flights from Cuba](/IMG/cuba-flights.png)

# Other analysis

- Granma headlines

- Cuba centric cartogram. Maybe something like https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/a-smooth-transition-between-chloropleth-and-cartogram.html using some measure of what countries are more important.

# Running locally

You can start an RStudio server by running `run.sh`. It will build and run a docker container with all the files required for the code in this repository.
